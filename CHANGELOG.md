## Fixed
* Various documentation fixes ([#140](https://github.com/algorand/pyteal/pull/140), [#142](https://github.com/algorand/pyteal/pull/142), [#191](https://github.com/algorand/pyteal/pull/191), [#202](https://github.com/algorand/pyteal/pull/202), [#207](https://github.com/algorand/pyteal/pull/207))

## Changed
* **WARNING**: Due to code generation improvements, programs compiled with this version will likely
  produce different TEAL code than previous versions, but their functionality will be the same. Be
  aware that even small differences in generated TEAL code will change the address associated with
  escrow LogicSig contracts.
* Optimized constant assembly for small integers ([#128](https://github.com/algorand/pyteal/pull/128))

## Changed
* **WARNING**: Due to code generation improvements, programs compiled with this version will likely
  produce different TEAL code than previous versions, but their functionality will be the same. Be
  aware that even small differences in generated TEAL code will change the address associated with
  escrow LogicSig contracts.
* Some unnecessary branch conditions have been removed ([#120](https://github.com/algorand/pyteal/pull/120))

* Added the `assembleConstants` option to `compileTeal`. When enabled, the compiler will assemble
int and byte constants in the most efficient way to reduce program size ([#57](https://github.com/algorand/pyteal/pull/57), [#61](https://github.com/algorand/pyteal/pull/61), [#66](https://github.com/algorand/pyteal/pull/66)).

* Align `Seq` with the rest of the API ([#96](https://github.com/algorand/pyteal/pull/96)).

## Fixed
* Fixed `NaryExpr.__str__` method ([#102](https://github.com/algorand/pyteal/pull/102)).

## Changed
* **WARNING**: Due to code generation changes required to support TEAL 4 loops and subroutines,
  programs compiled with this version will likely produce different TEAL code than previous
  versions, but their functionality will be the same. Be aware that even small differences in
  generated TEAL code will change the address associated with escrow LogicSig contracts.
* Improved crypto cost docs ([#81](https://github.com/algorand/pyteal/pull/81)).
* Applied code formatter ([#100](https://github.com/algorand/pyteal/pull/100)).

* Added a warning when scratch slots are loaded before anything has been stored ([#47](https://github.com/algorand/pyteal/pull/47)).

## Changed
* Rewrote internal code generation to produce smaller programs and make future optimization easier
([#26](https://github.com/algorand/pyteal/pull/26)). Programs compiled with this version will likely
produce different TEAL code than previous versions, but their functionality will be the same.

## Fixed
* Corrected documentation and examples that incorrectly used the `Txn.accounts` array ([#42](https://github.com/algorand/pyteal/pull/42)).
* Fixed improper base32 validation and allow the use of padding ([#34](https://github.com/algorand/pyteal/pull/34)
and [#37](https://github.com/algorand/pyteal/pull/37)).

# 0.6.1

## Added
* An application deployment example, `vote_deploy.py`.

## Fixed
* Internal modules no longer pollute the global namespace when importing with `from pyteal import *`
([#29](https://github.com/algorand/pyteal/pull/29)).

* The API for group transactions has changed from `Gtxn.field(transaction_index)` to `Gtxn[transaction_index].field()`.
* `Tmpl` syntax has changed from `Type(Tmpl("TMPL_NAME"))` to `Tmpl.Type("TMPL_NAME")`.
